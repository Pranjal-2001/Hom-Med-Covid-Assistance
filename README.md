## What is it?

Using real-time database, our team has developed a technical guide for every single person who needs immediate medical assistance in 
this desperate times of need in accordance with the pandemic.

We have made a software which assists in constantly faced problems like availability of oxygen/non-oxygen beds , booking the slots for 
vaccination or direct conversation with medical experts at any hour.

During the pandemic, people were not able to find beds for patients who urgently needed it. Due to this problem, we suffered an 
unfortunate number of lives. We as a team aim for a situation where in if any person needs immediate medical assistance or bed for any 
patient, should not waste time in actually visiting each hospital. They can see availabilty in our software and have immedate conversation 
regarding the same. Also people can easily book slots for vaccination (if available).
